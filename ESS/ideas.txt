The industrial trend
shows that they are the driving force in many application
domains that build smart or intelligent systems, including areas
such as automotive electronics, avionics, consumer electronics,
railways, telecommunications, and healthcare [3]

Security is an important issue because of the roles of
embedded systems in many mission and safety-critical systems. Attacks on cyber systems are proved to cause physical
damages [4]. However, comparing to conventional IT systems,
security of embedded systems is no better due to poor security
design and implementation and the difficulty of continuous
patching [5]. Although many approaches have been proposed
in the past to secure embedded systems [6], [7], various facts
such as deployment scale, resource limitations, the difficulty
of physical protection, and cost consideration all make it very
challenging to secure them [8], particularly for devices with
remote control, maintenance and operation functions
